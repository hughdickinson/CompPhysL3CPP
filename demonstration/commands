# The following command is (almost) the simplest possible
# invocation of the clang++ utility. It will automatically
# perform all the stages of translation and compilation that
# are required to convert the C++ code within exampleMain.cpp
# into a binary executable called exampleExecutable

clang++ -o exampleExecutable exampleMain.cpp

# We should now verify that exampleExecutable has indeed been
# created with the correct permissions.

ls -l exampleExecutable

# Now we can try running the executable that we have created.
# NOTE: For the moment we must explicity specify the path to 
#       exampleExecutable - either as an absolute path or
#       the "." token to specify the current directory.

./exampleExecutable 

# Finally, Let's add a few command line arguments

./exampleExecutable Spanish Old "In the "
